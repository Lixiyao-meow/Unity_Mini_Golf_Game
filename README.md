# Unity Mini Golf Game

This game is designed to be played in a VR headset. Please note that we have only tested the game on the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

## Introduction
Our game is designed for multiple players to build their own track and play golf together via the Ubiq platform. At the start, players join a room using the Ubiq panel to connect with other players on different machines. First, they need to build the golf track and place obstacles on it. Players are provided with one panel of track patches and one panel of obstacles. They can click on a patch on the panel to spawn it and link it to the current track. They can also add obstacles to the track in the same way. After editing the golf track, players can take turns playing golf. We have a scoreboard to keep track of the current putt count. After one round, we reset the count to zero and put the golf ball back at the start of the track.

The track editing scene is named **Snapping** and we also build a complete golf track in the **Minigolf** scene for gameplay.

## Controls
If playing in Unity:
